General ideas
==============
- study of the human mind capacities in terms of changing the common states of consciousness (through meditation, hypnosis) to better understand the mind and brain and the possibilities to "get better" without medication
- better understanm

- neurofeedback

- NIRS
- TMS

 1. Introduction, state of the art, objective and overview of the action

Background
----------
Mental imagery is the ability to reactivate and manipulate modality-specific mental representation in the absence of current sensory stimulation. Mental imagery is a pervasive experience of every day life. 
It is present when you are day dreaming and see yourself at the top of a mountain while being seated at your office. Mental imagery is also a phenomenon that is being used to induce specific states of consciousness as in hypnosis and meditation.
Mental imagery is also used in clinical settings for rehabilitation or in sports to increase performances.
Indeed, mentally imagining an action is affecting the same neural networks as physically performing this action.

In hypnosis people can get deeply engaged in multimodal mental images: seeing themselves at the sea, feeling the heat of the sun on their skin and the tatse of salt in their mouth, listening to sound of the waves.

Yet there are individual differences in the capacity to create mental images.

Hypnosis is succesfully used in clinical settings to help reducing injections of anesthestized product, help recovery after operation as well as relieving of chronic pain.
The use of hypnosis in experimental settings help uncovering the functioning of diverse cognitive systems by altering their processes as well as pushing forward our understanding of consciousness.

Yet we lack a formal understanding of the way hypnosis work. 

Hypnosis: hetero-induced, role of social interaction (except for self-hypnosis)
Meditation: self induced (except guided meditation), role of satellite information ? (compliance to books, teaching of a meditation leader etc.. ?)

Mental imagery: self induced, often towards a goal (performance in sports, music). Requierement of a regular practice ?

Meditation is as well a mental practice that has proven to be successfull in clinical settings. 
Knowledge on cerebral basis of meditation has greatly advanced in the past 10 years. 

Research questions
------------------

- similarities/difference between meditation, hypnosis and mental imagery ?
    * neural correlates
    * phenomenology
    * effects on the body/mind

- study of spontaneous thoughts as they manifest during mind wandering
    * Can we find mental imagery during mind wandering ?
    * How do spontaneous thoughts emerge: brain activity (DMN ?), EEG correlates of DMN
    * In which conditions do they emerge
    * What are their outcome ? When is it beneficial / detrimental ?
    * Role of the precuneus ? Would its activity trigger spontaneous mental imagery ? In what conditions ?
    * TDSC/TMS on precuneus
    * Meditation: a state with no spontaneous thoughts
    * Hypnosis : ? Based on mental imagery, Spontaneous thoughts seem to be reduced but how ? Can there be mind wandering during hypnosis ?



 2. Research methodology and approach
